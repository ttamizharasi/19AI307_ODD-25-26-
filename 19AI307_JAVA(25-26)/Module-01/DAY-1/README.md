# Ex.No:1(A) INTRODUCTION TO JAVA PROGRAMMING, DATA TYPES, VARIABLES AND OPERATORS

## QUESTION:
Lovely found a magic machine that tells her how two numbers relate to each other.
The machine supports all 6 relational operators:

Operator	Meaning
==	Is equal to
!=	Is not equal to
>	Greater than
<	Less than
>=	Greater than or equal to
<=	Less than or equal to
Lovely enters two numbers. The machine prints the result (true or false) for each operator.

Input Format
First line: First integer number (a)

Second line: Second integer number (b)

Output Format
Print:

a == b: <true/false>
a != b: <true/false>
a > b: <true/false>
a < b: <true/false>
a >= b: <true/false>
a <= b: <true/false>

For example:

Input	Result
-5
0
a == b: false
a != b: true
a > b: false
a < b: true
a >= b: false
a <= b: true
